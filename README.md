# Time-Series Analysis and Prediction Projects

## Overview
This repository contains two time-series analysis and prediction projects. Each project focuses on applying machine learning models to different datasets for forecasting key variables (oil temperature and stock prices). For more details on each project, refer to the respective personal project folders.

## Projects

### 1. **Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM**
This project involves predicting the stock prices of NTT using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The goal is to forecast stock closing prices based on historical data, using both univariate and multivariate LSTM approaches.

- **Files**: 
  - Stock price dataset: `stock_price.csv`
  - Jupyter Notebook: `code.ipynb`
  
- **Key Techniques**:
  - LSTM modeling (univariate and multivariate)
  - Data visualization and preprocessing
  - Model evaluation using RMSE and MAE

### 2. **Oil Temperature Prediction Using Time-Series Data**
This project aims to predict oil temperature using time-series data from the ETDataset. It focuses on analyzing and forecasting transformer health by monitoring oil temperature and related parameters.

- **Files**:
  - Oil temperature dataset: `ett.csv`
  - Jupyter Notebook: `code.ipynb`
  
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Time-series analysis and EDA
  - Feature engineering and data preprocessing
  - Model evaluation using MAE and RMSE
